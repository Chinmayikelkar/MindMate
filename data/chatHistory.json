    "assistant": "Hi, my heart goes out to you.  It's completely understandable that you're feeling sad and nervous after learning about the loss of your classmate. This is a very difficult and painful situation, and it's natural to have a lot of emotions swirling around right now. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay if accepting this takes time.  There's no right or wrong way to feel.\n\nRemember you're not alone in this.  Many people are probably feeling similarly right now. Talking about it can sometimes help, whether it's with a friend, family member, teacher, counselor, or another trusted adult.  They can offer support and understanding during this difficult time.\n\nIf you feel you need some space and quiet time to process your feelings, that's perfectly alright too.  Maybe try some gentle activities like listening to calming music, spending time in nature, or doing something creative that you enjoy.  Taking care of yourself is especially important right now.  If the feelings continue to be overwhelming, reaching out to a school counselor or joining a support group could be beneficial in providing further comfort and guidance.  Thinking of you and sending strength your way.\n"
